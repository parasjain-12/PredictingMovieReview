# PredictingMovieReview

Here we used two dataset one had reviews and other had labels whether the movie has Positive or Negative review.
We then check which word effect the labels most.
For this purpose we use counter to find the no.of occurence of all the words in positive and negative review.
We then calculate the positive-to-negative ratio .After finding this we can see that some words effect the most
